# Online-Shopping-Cart-Using-C
You must have done online shopping and may be aware of the small shopping cart icon. Write a program to implement that. Display a menu of 20 items with rates. Customers will select items from this list one by one and quantity to buy. Once the customer checks out, you should display the complete list of items purchased, their individual rates, amount for each item and finally the total bill amount. Please note that there can be a discount on a few items which will be displayed in the menu (discount may depend on the quantity). All similar items should be added together for billing.
